  Are you ready for this, Amy?” David asked his daughter. The girl finished tying the laces of her old walking boots, looked up and nodded
  slowly. “I think so.” They walked along a lane out of the village until they reached a gently winding path that led to the river. After
  crossing a wooden bridge, they followed the line of the riverbank, where tall trees kept the hot sun off their heads. David listened to
  the chatter of the fast-flowing river. The last time they had come this way, he had listened to a chattering stream of words from his
  daughter, who had told him about endless adventures and the scandals of friends and classmates. Today, as they had crossed the bridge, a
  little grey and yellow bird had caught her eye. Amy’s face had brightened, and the start of a story almost reached her lips, but then she
  remained silent. The path became steeper, leaving the river and splitting into two parts as they came closer to Kinder Reservoir. Looking
  at his map, David pointed to the route that climbed above the reservoir. They followed it to the start of a narrow valley, where another
  steep path ran beside a fast-moving stream. As they climbed higher, Amy began to notice the changing landscape. The stream was a series of
  little waterfalls that fell through green ferns and purple heather.

  When people ask me how I learned to speak German, I tell them it was simple: I met a German man at the Oktoberfest, married him, and
  stayed in Munich for 20 years. But there’s a bit of a backstory, too. In 1973, my friend Sally and I decided to quit our jobs and travel
  through Europe. We boarded a plane in early September, determined to stay abroad as long as possible — stretching our money by hitchhiking
  and staying in youth hostels. Over the next eight months, we covered a lot of ground, from Greece and Turkey to Finland, managing to limit
  our costs to an average of $5 a day. It all started in Luxembourg, when we walked to the edge of town and stuck out our thumbs. It wasn’t
  long before a group of US soldiers on motorcycles stopped. They were on their way to a wine festival on the Moselle River and were
  thrilled to have female companionship.

  As 24-year-old American girls with backpacks, Sally and I rarely had to wait long for a ride. And although we often couldn’t understand
  the drivers, it didn’t matter. Wherever they were going was fine with us. Other than our plans to visit the Oktoberfest in Munich, we had
  absolutely no itinerary. The advantage of this easygoing lifestyle was that we visited many villages that were far off the beaten path.
